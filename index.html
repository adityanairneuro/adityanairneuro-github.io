<p1>The brain displays a dazzling amount of complexity, with brain cells of all shapes and sizes (which I took photos of above!) driving our perceptions, thoughts and emotions. </p1>
<br>
			<br>
<p1>Unravelling this complexity is the heart of neuroscience and something I hope to contribute to in grad school at Caltech!</p1>
<br>
			<br>
<p1>My exposure to neuroscience stems from our experiences at the lab of Gilad Silberberg Lab during my undergraduate at the Karolinska Institute and later at the lab of George Augustine during my thesis and post baccalaureate year at the Agency of Science, Technology and Research, Singapore.</p1>

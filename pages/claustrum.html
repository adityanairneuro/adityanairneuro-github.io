<p1>Over the past two years I studied the neural circuits of the Claustrum, a structure of the brain that's been hypothesized to control higher level cognition and possibly even consciousness!. </p1>
<br>
			<br>
<p1>We made great strides in understanding the microcircuit of this structure and how neuromodulators regulate information flow through the claustrum at the lab of George Augustine at <a href = "http://www.lkcmedicine.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/Home.aspx">LKCMedicine, NTU</a></p1>

<h2> A Claustrum Cartograph</h2>

<p1> What kind of neurons exist in the claustrum and what does this diversity mean for the function of the claustrum? We studied this question in our paper published in eNeuro <a href = "https://www.eneuro.org/content/7/4/ENEURO.0216-20.2020"> (Graf, Nair et al., 2020)</a> and discovered a rich variety of claustrum neurons that differ in their intrinsic electrophysiological properties.</p1>

<p1>We even created a user-friendly software that allows researchers to look for these diverse neurons using machine-learning aided classification.

Hereâ€™s How to Find Them!</a></p1>

<p1>Stay tuned for more of our upcoming papers where we describe how neuromodulator pave the way for the claustrum to regulate sleep and attention!</p1>
